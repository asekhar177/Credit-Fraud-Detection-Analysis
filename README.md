# Credit-Fraud-Detection-Analysis

The Credit Fraud Detection data is derived from a project in Kaggle (see link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) with the intention of decoding and modelling the transactions from September 2013 by European cardholders. The data itself is drawn from transactions across two calendar days, comprising of 492 fraudulent transactions from 284,807 transactions. Note that this data contains only numeric variables, which are a resultant of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This means the original raw data features are unknown for the purposes of this exercise.
